# ft_push_swap

The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted.
You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.

Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.

# Easy? Weâ€™ll see...

- I've just used an algorithm described in [this guide](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97). But if you have at least one week to think about the project, you'll invent your own algorithm and it would be much more fun.
- To test the algorithm I've used [that visualizer](https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer)
